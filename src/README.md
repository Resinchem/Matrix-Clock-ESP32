### If you just want to install the firmware on your ESP32, you do not need to download the source code!
Just download the latest **MatrixClock_vx.xx_ESP32.bin** file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Resinchem/Matrix-Clock-ESP32/releases) and follow the installation and instructions that are found in the [wiki](https://github.com/Resinchem/Matrix-Clock-ESP32/wiki).  Please try the steps in the wiki before posting questions about how to install the firmware.

## Source Code
If you want to modify the source code, you need both files (.ino and .h) from this folder.  More information on modifying the source code can be found in the wiki.
