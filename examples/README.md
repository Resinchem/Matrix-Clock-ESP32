This folder contains examples to assist you in using or adapting the project to your own needs.

**THESE ARE EXAMPLES ONLY**

There is almost a certainty that the files will need some sort of modification for your particular situation.  For this reason, do not expect to just copy/paste into your own system(s) and expect it to work.  Read any documention or related inline comments in the examples for more information.

**THESE EXAMPLES ARE FOR REFERENCE ONLY AND MAY OR MAY NOT WORK FOR YOU!!!**

_/homeassistant_: 

Contains sample YAML for creating entites and a dashboard to integrate this system into Home Assistant. Note that Home Assistant use is entirely _optional_ and is not required for any function or feature of the matrix display.  Home Assistant just provides yet another way to control the matrix and/or to include it in your other automations.
