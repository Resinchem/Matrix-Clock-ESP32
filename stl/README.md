### 3D Printed Parts
A few optional 3D printed enclosure design files are provided here.  Note that use of 3D printed parts is _entirely optional_ and is not required for system functionality.  You can substitue project boxes or omit enclosures altogether.

All enclosures were printed with PLA.  **Supports are highly recommended for all parts**.

#### Button Case

This enclosure house the physical controls for attaching to the frame of the matrix.  It houses the rotary encoder, three push buttons and the indoor temperature sensor.

#### Controller Enclosure 
![ControllerEnclosure_Small](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d2cd041-54e4-459e-8c3b-3f3c07e7eebb)

A simple enclosure for the ESP32 controller.  Designed for a standard 1/2 size ElectroCookie solderable breadboard with height to accommodate pin headers.  Mounting posts that accept M2 screws elevates the ElectroCookie board so that wiring may be completed on the top or bottom of the board.  This design works for both the clock and WLED controllers as shown in the build.

#### INMP441 Mount

This houses the INMP441 digital microphone.  This is only used if installing the secondary WLED controller and if you want sound-reactivity.  The mount includes small tabs for optionally mounting the mic to the frame of the matrix.

_These files are provided "as-is" and unfortunately I cannot modify or print parts for individual use._
