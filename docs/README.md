The remaining three .jpg files are simply larger versions of wiring diagrams from the written blog article. They are **_not_** meant to be complete build instructions.  The written guide should be used as it contains much more information, including:

- Step-by-step instructions for building the matrix, controller(s) and control box
- A complete parts list, including parts can be substitued or even omitted
- Important information on selecting power supply and appropriate wiring
- Information and sample dimensions for building a frame
- Caveats, special notes and other important points to consider
